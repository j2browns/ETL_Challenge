    "# ETL Assignment - Jeff Brown\n",
    "#### In this assignment I create a database using the number of different makes of used cars available for sale in different states.  The data is taken from Craigslist.  In the same database is a table with the population for each state.  This allows analysis of differences in preferences in cars by state and also to see if there is a correlation to the number of cars and population in the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The data is for cars manufactured between 2010 and 2015 and broken into the following makes: subaru\",\"honda\", \"toyota\",\"BMW\",\"mercedes\",\"ford\",\"chrysler-dodge\", \"chevrolet\".  The search is limited to states with a population exceeding 10,000,000.  This is done partially for ease of grading.  Even limited to 10,000,000 the acquisition of the data takes 15 minutes since it has to go to every city in Craigslist for the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The number of cars for sale is scraped from Craigslist, the population data is taken from an API call to census.gov and the state abbreviation (needed for the Craigslist search) is scraped from wordpopulationreview.com."
